unix-scripts
============

Scripts to simplify working with my other open-source repositories.

- cloneall - 

- checkall - 

Currently these scripts are configured to handle six repositories:

- DebugUtil
- DevUtil
- FilesUtil
- MapUtil
- StringMapMaker
- unix-scripts

each with its own 'ReadMe' describing its purpose and use. I hope you find them helpful.
